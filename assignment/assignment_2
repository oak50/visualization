Private for-profit institutions have a 46.88% incidence rate of 2-year program stucture and a 53.12% incidence rate of 4-year program structure.
Public institutions have a 59.43% incidence rate of 2-year program structure and a 40.57% incidence rate of 4-year program structure.
Private not for-profit institutions have a 5.45% incidence rate of 2-year program structure and a 94.55% incidence rate of 4-year program structure.

This likely reflects that many community colleges are public, whereas private not-for-profit schools tend not to be community colleges.
Private for-profit schools are often fast-track degree programs, which reflects the high incidence rate of for-profit 2 year programs.

# 4. generate histogram, kernel density plot, boxplot, and statistical description for the grad_100_value variable:

plt.ion()


# HISTOGRAM:
import seaborn as sns

sns.histplot(df['grad_100_value'])
plt.savefig("grad_hist.png")
plt.show()

# KERNEL DENSITY PLOT
sns.kdeplot(df['grad_100_value'])
plt.savefig("grad_kdp.png")
plt.show()

# BOXPLOT
sns.boxplot(df["grad_100_value"])
plt.show()
plt.savefig("grad_boxplot")


# STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION
print( df['grad_100_value'].describe() )


# 5. create kernel density plot for grad_100_value variable for level and control

sns.kdeplot(data=df,x='grad_100_value',hue="control")

# The kernel density plot for institution type (public, private non-profit, and private for-profit) shows a sharp peak at
# ~15% graduation rate for public institutions with a right skew, whereas the graphs for both types of private insttituions are
# more uniformly distributed with seemingly higher median values for graduation rate.

# The kernel density plot for level shows a sharper peak and lower mean graduation rate for 2-year institutions compared
# to 4-year institutions.abs

# The KDE plots reflect the median graduation rate values shown in the statistical decription table. Public institutions
# and 2 year institutions are shown to have 13.2% and 13.0% median graduation rates, respectively, which are the lowest 
# median grd rate values in their respective cohorts.abs


# 6. Create a new variable, df['levelXcontrol']=df['level']+', '+df['control']. that interacts level and control. 
# Make a grouped kernel density plot. Which institutions appear to have the best graduation rates?

df['level_control']=df['level']+', '+df['control']

# at 44.4%. 4-year not-for-profit insttitutions have the second highest median grad rate at 41%.



# 7. Make a kernel density plot of aid_value. Now group your graph by level and control. What explains the shape of 
# the graph? Use groupby and .describe to make grouped calculations of statistical descriptions of aid_value by 
# level and control.

# regular kde plot for aid_value

# Public and private for-profit universities have low median aid values compared to private NFP universities, and both of 
# their graphs have a strong peak at around $4,500. This explains the large amount of universities with median aid amounts 
# around this amount, as shown in the graph hich combines controls. Two year schools also give out less aid, on average,
# than 4-year-schools, which contributes to the peak effect on the combined kde graph.abs


# 8. Make a scatterplot of grad_100_value by aid_value. Describe what you see. Now make the same plot, grouping by level 
# and then control. Describe what you see. For which kinds of institutions does aid seem to increase graduation rates?

# make scatter for grad rate and aid value
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="aid_value", y="grad_100_value")
plt.show()
plt.savefig("grad_aid_scatter.png")

# observations -- one section of the data appears to reflect a positive association between aid value and graduation rate.abs
# However, there is a section of aid values (on the lower side of the aid value sprectrum) for which aid value appears to
# have no correlation with graduation rate.abs

# make the same plot, grouping by level and then control

# Group by level:
sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='aid_value',y="grad_100_value",hue='level')
plt.show()
plt.savefig("scatter_aidgrad_level.png")

# Group by control:
sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='aid_value',y="grad_100_value",hue='control')
plt.show()
plt.savefig("scatter_aidgrad_control.png")

# make scatter incorporating level_control variable
sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='aid_value',y='grad_100_value',hue='level_control')
plt.show()
plt.savefig("scatter_aidgrad_levelcontrol")

# Aid seems to increase graduation rates primarily for 4-year private, not for profit universities. This makes sense, 
# as 4 year private universities tend to have high tuition rates which carry over four years. Therefore, it is reasonable
# financial aid would have a higher marinal impact on graduation rates for these schools, when compared to 2 year schools 
# and private schools. However, it's interesting that 4 year private for-profit institutions seem to exhibit less positive association 
# between financial and grad rate.
